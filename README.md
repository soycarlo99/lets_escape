# React Code Editor with TypeScript

This project implements an interactive code editor using React and TypeScript, featuring the Monaco Editor, support for multiple programming languages, and a puzzle system.

## How to Set Up the Project

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    If you haven't already, install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    *(Note: This assumes you have Node.js and npm/yarn installed.)*

2.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Run the following command to start the local development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port).

## Implementation Notes

1.  **Monaco Editor Integration:**
    *   The `EditorView` component initializes Monaco Editor within a `ref` container.
    *   Monaco Editor is configured for each supported language within the component.

2.  **Code Execution:**
    *   JavaScript code (including puzzle solutions) is executed directly in the browser using the `Function` constructor.
    *   Console output is captured and displayed.
    *   For other languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, Go, Rust, TypeScript), execution is simulated with mock results for demonstration purposes.
    *   In a real production application, non-JavaScript code execution would require a backend service to securely compile/interpret and run the code in an isolated environment.

3.  **State Management:**
    *   The main application state (current language, code, selected puzzle, output) is managed in the `App` component using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`).
    *   Props are passed down to child components (`EditorView`, `OutputView`, `LanguageSelector`, `PuzzleSelector`).

4.  **TypeScript Types:**
    *   Strong typing is used throughout the application, defining interfaces and types for puzzles (`Puzzle`, `PuzzleTest`), languages (`Language`), and test results (`TestResult`).

5.  **Responsive Design:**
    *   Basic responsive styles are included in `App.css` to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
    *   The editor and output areas resize appropriately, stacking vertically on smaller screens and sitting side-by-side on larger ones.

## Extensions and Future Improvements

1.  **Backend Integration:**
    *   Implement a backend service (e.g., using Node.js, Python/Flask/Django, Go) to handle secure execution of non-JavaScript code.
    *   Create API endpoints for code submission, execution, and test verification.

2.  **Authentication:**
    *   Add user accounts (e.g., using Firebase Auth, Auth0, or a custom solution) to allow users to save their code, progress, and potentially created puzzles.

3.  **Additional Features:**
    *   Expand the library of puzzles and supported programming languages.
    *   Implement features like code sharing (generating unique URLs for code snippets) or embedding the editor.
    *   Add options for customizing syntax highlighting themes.
    *   Create a user interface for creating and managing custom puzzles.

4.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Optimize the loading of Monaco Editor, possibly using the `monaco-editor-webpack-plugin` if bundling with Webpack directly (Create React App handles some optimizations, but further tuning might be needed for large-scale apps).
    *   Implement code splitting to load components or features on demand, improving initial load time.
